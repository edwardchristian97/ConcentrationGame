Hello, this is my first iOS Application.

### Welcome to the Concentration Game. This is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. For this game, I used 12 cards with emojis on them.

## IMPORTANT: 
    The game is designed only for the iPhone X

RULES:
    - You can't flip a card twice in the same turn
    - You can flip only two cards at a time
    - If the cards are matched, you have to wait for them to disappear automatically
    - If the cards are not matched, you have to wait for them to flip back
    - You win the game after you match all the cards
    
FEATURES:
    - Reset game button, placed in the top right corner
    - Best score, placed in the top left corner (less flips means a better score)
    - New game button after you win
